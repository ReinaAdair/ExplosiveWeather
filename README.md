How to run:

gameGui.py is the GUI portion of the game and will be the file that you run in order to run the game.

In order to run this you are going to need python/python interpreter installed or some kind of IDE. 
You are also going to need PySimpleGUI and requests python packages. We are assuming that python portion should be self explanatory. 
However for the packages if you do not already have them, here is how to install them using the pip in a windows command line:

Open your command line via running as an administrator.

Type in: pip install -r requirements.txt

Once everything is installed run gameGui.py with all of the other files in the same directory.
